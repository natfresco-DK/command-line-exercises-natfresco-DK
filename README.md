# Command Line Exercises

These are a series of command line exercises to help you become more proficient with the command line interface.

**Advice**: Don't solve them all at once. Solve them over multiple days in order to reinforce learning the commands. 

---

# How to solve

In `exercises.md` in root do what it says. 

First create the `cli_sandbox` directory on your computer. 

In your terminal figure out the commands required to solve each exercise and run them.

Below each exercise either write the command you used to solve it or write the words: "NOT POSSIBLE".

Be aware to never leave the `cli_sandbox` directory and change things on your computer.
